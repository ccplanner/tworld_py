This is the tile world agent you can build and install under linux with

$ sudo python setup.py install

then run agent.py 

$ python agent.py

Requires

sudo apt-get install python python-dev qt qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libsdl-dev

You should be in this directory when you do this.  You will need to select the
level set manually.  Then provide the first move.  After that the agent will 
run on it's own.  You will have to kill the program to stop it at this point.

After checking out you need to run make to get things working.  Provide the QTDIR 
enviroment varible to help out.

Also make sure SDL-dev is installed
Ensure the QT is set to 4, as well as moc and uic under debian do:
sudo update-alternatives --config qmake
sudo update-alternatives --config moc
sudo update-alternatives --config uic

$ make

This should fail with an error about do_move().  That means it did it's job.  After
tworld.c:(.text+0x29a4): undefined reference to `do_move'
this is done.

$ sudo python setup.py install 


make moc_TWMainWnd.cpp
Check README.tileworld for more infomation

Also needed to do is to setup levelsets, you can create soft links from 
levelset/data/*.dat to data/*.dat
and from levelset/sets/*.dac to sets/*.dac
