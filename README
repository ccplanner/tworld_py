This is the tile world agent you can build and install under linux with

$ sudo python setup.py install

then run agent.py 

$ python agent.py

You should be in this directory when you do this.  You will need to select the
level set manually.  Then provide the first move.  After that the agent will 
run on it's own.  You will have to kill the program to stop it at this point.
