This is the tile world agent you can build and install under linux with

$ sudo python setup.py install

then run agent.py 

$ python agent.py

You should be in this directory when you do this.  You will need to select the
level set manually.  Then provide the first move.  After that the agent will 
run on it's own.  You will have to kill the program to stop it at this point.

After checking out you need to run make to get things working.  Provide the QTDIR 
enviroment varible to help out.

$ QTDIR="/usr" make

This should fail with an error about do_move().  That means it did it's job.  After
this is done.

$ sudo ptyon setup.py install 

Also make sure SDL-dev is installed
Ensure the QT is set to 4, as well as moc and uic under debian do:
sudo update-alternatives --config qmake
sudo update-alternatives --config moc
sudo update-alternatives --config uic

make moc_TWMainWnd.cpp
